# 🎢 Roller Coaster Height & Drop Analysis

This project explores the tallest roller coaster drops in the world and where they are located geographically.

Using a cleaned dataset of top roller coasters from Makeover Monday, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard and a short presentation to analyze:
- The tallest drops vs total ride height
- Geographic distribution of extreme roller coasters
- Why most of the world’s biggest drops are located in the USA

## 📊 Tools Used
- Tableau (dashboard & mapping)
- Excel (data exploration)
- Canva (presentation design)

## 📁 Project Files
- `data/` – Dataset used for the analysis  
- `dashboard/` – Tableau packaged workbook (.twbx)  
- `presentation/` – PDF version of the presentation

## 📌 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Makeover Monday**, a community-driven data visualization initiative that provides curated datasets for learning and practice.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Roller coaster drops are much taller than they sound.
- “Height” and “drop” are not the same thing.
- The majority of the tallest drops are concentrated in the United States.

## 🚀 Notes
This project was created for learning and storytelling purposes for my friends.
No roller coasters were ridden during the analysis.
